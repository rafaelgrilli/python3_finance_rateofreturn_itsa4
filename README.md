# python3forfinance
I use this repository to share data sets and codes for different sorts of finance applications and data manipulation with Python. 
I provide the codes and a brief explanation about what is being calculated, as well as the code source when available. 
I assume any eventual user knows what a Monte Carlo Simulation (for instance) means, and so the code will make more sense.
