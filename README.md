# python3forfinance
I use this repository to share data sets and codes for different sorts of finance applications, mainly related to investment and portfolio management. 
On the 14 branches, I provide the codes and a brief explanation about what is being calculated. 
I assume any eventual user knows what a Monte Carlo Simulation means, and so the code will make more sense.
Most data was from Brazilian stocks, which I usually follow since 2012.
